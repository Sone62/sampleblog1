      <h3>How to Prioritise Your Decluttering Decisions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>1. Repair First:</strong> If your item can be fixed, repairing is the most sustainable choice. It saves resources and reduces waste.</li>
        <li><strong>2. Donate if Usable:</strong> If your item is in good condition but you no longer need it, consider donating. This gives your item a second life and helps others.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Recycle Responsibly:</strong> If your item is broken beyond repair or not suitable for donation, recycle it at an appropriate facility to keep it out of landfill.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Consider Distance:</strong> Choose options that are closer to you to reduce your carbon footprint and make the process more convenient.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Tip: Start by checking for nearby repair shops or donation points before heading to a recycling bin. Every small action helps the environment!</em>

    <h3>Repair and Repurpose</h3>

      <br>Before you throw away an item, consider if it can be repaired or repurposed. 
      Many items can have a second life with a little creativity!
      <br>For example, old t-shirts can be turned into cleaning rags or tote bags.
      Broken furniture can be refurbished or upcycled into something new.
      <br>Check out our <a href="/gen_repair">Repair</a> section for local repair shops and resources.</p>
