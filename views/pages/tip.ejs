        <p>Before you throw away an item, consider if it can be repaired or repurposed. 
        Many items can have a second life with a little creativity!</p>
        <p>For example, old t-shirts can be turned into cleaning rags or tote bags.
        Broken furniture can be refurbished or upcycled into something new.</p>
